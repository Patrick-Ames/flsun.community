## Maximum print dimensions? (QQ/QQ-S)

- 260 x 320/370 (cylinder+cone) - 210 x 180/210 (Q5)
- It's a 260mm wide x 320mm tall cylinder, topped off with a 50mm tall "cone" (not a true cone, since the sides are defined by arcs, not straight lines)

## What's the QQ-S Pro?

- It's a QQ-S that comes with the leveling switch instead of the leveling pad
- QQ-S Pro has a "true" power switch by the cord jack, no switch on the front
- Note that Flsun makes changes all the time, so there are units with mixed parts.
